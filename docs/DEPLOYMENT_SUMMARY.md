## 📝 Known Issues & Limitations

### Budget Warnings

```
Warning: layout.component.scss exceeded maximum budget. 
Budget 10.00 kB was not met by 1.92 kB with a total of 11.92 kB.

Warning: vehicle-dashboard.component.scss exceeded maximum budget. 
Budget 10.00 kB was not met by 128 bytes with a total of 10.13 kB.
```

**Status:** ⚠️ Acceptable  
**Reason:** Comprehensive design system requires more CSS. Trade-off for maintainability and consistency.  
**Mitigation:** Can be optimized in Phase 6 with CSS purging and critical CSS extraction.
